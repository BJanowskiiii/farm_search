*Animal Farm Search is a full-stack application built using **Vite, React**, and **Express**. It serves as an example of a client-side web application.

*The application allows users to search for various animals. The search is conducted in real-time, and the results are instantly displayed to the user.

*For building the frontend, I used **React** with **Vite**, instead of the traditional command: npx create-react-app, thereby reducing the package size.

*The **Express.js** server serves as the backend of our application, providing an API endpoint that returns data about the animals. **CORS** is used as middleware in Express to avoid CORS origin request issues
